// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

prompt input of n1
prompt input of n2
calculate sum=n1+n2
display sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

prompt input of number
if number%2==0 
print "even number"
else, print "odd number" 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

prompt input of n1
prompt input of n2
prompt input of n3
prompt input of n4
prompt input of n5
calculate avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5) / 5

read n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 
if n1 > n2, n3, n4, n5 
then maximum = n1
else, if n2 > n1, n3, n4, n5 
then maximum = n2
else, if n3 > n1, n2, n4, n5 
then maximum = n3
else, if n4 > n1, n2, n4, n5 
then maximum = n4
else, maximum = n5

read n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
if n1 < n2, n3, n4, n5 
then minimum = n1
else, if n2 < n1, n3, n4, n5 
then minimum = n2
else, if n3 < n1, n2, n4, n5 
then minimum = n3
else, if n4 < n1, n2, n4, n5 
then minimum = n4
else, minimum = n5

print("Average:", avg)
lines 24-29 get 5 input values
line 29 finds the average of the 5 numbers

print("Largest", maximum)
line 31 reads 5 inputed values
lines 32-40 compare each number against the others
starting at line 31 comparison will continue until condition is met
condition met is largest number

print("Smallest:", minimum)
line 42 reads 5 inputed values
lines 43-51 compare each number against the others
starting at line 42 comparison will continue until condition is met
condition met is smallest number
